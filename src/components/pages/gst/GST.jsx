                            Launched on July 1 2017, the Goods & Services Tax (GST) applies to all Indian service
                            providers (including freelancers), traders and manufacturers. A variety of Central taxes like
                            Service Tax, Excise Duty, CST and state taxes like Entertainment Tax, Luxury Tax, Octroi, VAT
                            are absorbed in one tax â€“ GST, implemented on 01.07.2017. GST is to be charged at every step of
                            the supply chain, with full set-off benefits available. The procedure for GST is entirely online
                            and requires no manual intervention..
                        </p>
                        <p className="my-4">
                            Every product goes through multiple stages along the supply chain, which includes the purchasing
                            of raw materials, manufacturing, sale to the wholesaler, selling to the retailer and then the
                            final sale to the consumer. Interestingly, GST will be levied on all of these 3 stages. Letâ€™s
                            say if a product is produced in West Bengal but is being consumed in Uttar Pradesh, the entire
                            revenue will go to Uttar Pradesh.

                            Also, taxpayers with a turnover of less than Rs.1.5 crore can choose composition scheme to get
                            rid of tedious GST formalities and pay GST at a fixed rate of turnover.

                            What are the components of GST?
                            GST will have 3 tax components, which includes a central component (Central Goods and
                            Services Tax or CGST) and a state component (State Goods and Services Tax or SGST) where
                            centre and state will levy GST on all entities, i.e. when a transaction happens within a
                            state. Inter-state transactions will attract the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST),
                            to be levied by the centre, i.e. when a transaction happens one state to another.

                            pay the balance liability of tax, i.e. tax on sale minus tax on the purchase.

                                        The composition scheme was introduced to reduce the compliance
                                        burden on small taxpayers and it allows them to file quarterly
                                        returns instead of monthly returns.
