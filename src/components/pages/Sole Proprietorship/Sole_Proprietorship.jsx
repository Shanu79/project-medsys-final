                            The Indian government has not established any separate rules and regulations for a sole proprietorship, and there is no registration process. The registration of the business can therefore only be identified on the basis of the tax registration required in the company. These tax registrations may include a GST registration and / or an SSI / MSME registration that must be obtained on behalf of the owner to determine that the owner runs the company as a sole proprietorship. Itâ€™s a good option for those who want to provide a platform to their business idea and try out something they want to do with minimal investment.

                            <p>The benefits of sole proprietorship is that it prevents double taxation of the firm. You will file returns and pay taxes only in your personal name. There are no separate income tax returns to be filed and no tax to be paid by the firm. The business is taxed at the personal income tax rate instead of the corporate tax rate. This leads to enormous tax savings.</p>
