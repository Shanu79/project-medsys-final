                    <p>The FSSAI License is primarily granted based on the scope of operation and production volume. The typical

                        </li>
                        <p>First, the license seeker is required to file Form B with the licensing authority. While doing so, the
                            applicant has to keep basic turnover criteria in the mind.</p>

                            for in-depth scrutiny.</p>

                        </li>
                        <p>In this step, the FSSAI will send the designated officials to the business place to determine the level of
                            compliance recommended by FSSAI
                            Any non-conformity in this regard could increase the chances of application cancellation.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>The Central FSSAI license comes with a flexible validity duration ranging from 1-5 years. The cost of the
                        license would increase in accordance with the validity period.
                        As far as the renewal is concerned, the central FSSAI license should be renewed before the 30 days of the
                        expiration date, or else the penalties would be levied. The process of renewal for a food license
                        is as simple as applying for the new license.
